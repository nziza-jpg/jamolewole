      <h1>Happy Anniversary my handsome boyfriend!</h1>
      <p>
        Words cannot express how grateful I am for you but this letter can try
        its best. 2 years! 733 days! Like if we put things into perspective it’s
        like a baby that’s finally able to kinda talk and walk. Isn’t that
        crazy? I use that analogy bc idk things have been rocky lately but
        that’s simply because we’re still learning how to walk together and
        talk. (Walk it like I talk it ayeeee) anyway yes but eventually the
        child grows and is able to effortlessly do the things they are wobbly at
        now. That will be us and I’m willing to fight for that.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        You’re the best boyfriend I could ever ask for and I will choose you
        every single day. I love the quiet moments, the times you’re laughing at
        absolute nonsense, and never repeat this but even the ragebait because
        it shows that you’re not afraid to be you around me and that all I hope
        for, that you see me as a safe space. I’m very grateful that you have
        given me a chance at experiencing true love and I have no intentions on
        taking that for granted. I will continue to grow and learn so that you
        are continuously loved the way you deserve to be.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        I can’t wait to experience more late night calls, birthdays, valentines,
        debates, dates, phone sex, laughs, cries, fit checks, random updates and
        life in general with you. I love you dearly and once again happy us
        day.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>Always and forever, </p>
      <p>~your former princess.</p>
